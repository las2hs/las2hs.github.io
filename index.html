            About me
        </div> -->
        <p> I study American literature, mostly from the long nineteenth century, focusing on Indigenous American literatures, American realism, environmental humanities, and film. I am an Assistant Professor of English at Yale University. My work appears or is forthcoming in a bevy of scholarly journals.</p><br><br>

        <p>My book project is called <em>The Shape of Forest to Come: The Environmental Imagination of Native US Literature</em>. It is about how Native writers from Apess to Zitkála-Šá responded to the broad-scale sylvan destruction of American environment by generating new ways of being with the self and with others.</p> <br> <br>

        <p>Prior to my graduate program, I got a bachelor's degree in computer science from Brown University and worked as a software developer. An article of mine about digital "mid-range reading" has appeared in <em>Victorian Studies</em>.</p> <br> <br>

        <p>I got my PhD at the University of Virginia, found in America's second-most beautiful city (Charlottesville); I grew up in America's most beautiful city (Rockford, IL), where I attended its top high school (Auburn). My family is originally from the Philippines. My principal affective attachment is to a <a href="pusheen.jpg">stuffed cat</a>. If you're a student or scholar at Yale—or anywhere—please reach out. I'd love to collaborate, talk, give advice, or generally chat.</p> <br>
