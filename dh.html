                CBW
        </div>
            Since 2018 I have been Project Manager of <a href="http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu">Collective Biographies of Women<a>, a digital project led by PI <a href="https://english.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/ab6j">Alison Booth</a>. CBW is composed of an annotated bibliography of women's biographies (mostly from 1800-1920) and the various projects/analyses we perform on those biographies. As PM, I train and direct a team of research assistants to use XML. We perform narratological analyses via a system we call BESS: I have blogged about BESS <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/bess-primer/">here</a> and written a Python script to analyze BESS available <a href="https://github.com/las2hs/bess-scrape/tree/main">here</a>. BESS is vital to performing what we call "mid-range reading"; a paper about this method is forthcoming in <em>Victorian Studies</em>.

                Virginia Discourse Lab
        </div>
            In 2020 I began assembling a <a href="https://discoursedict.herokuapp.com/discoursedict/">database of direct discourse</a> in novels. Based on this database, in 2022 I started the Virginia Discourse Lab, where I lead and collaborate with several undergraduate students at UVA. The project's large-scale goal is developing scholarly research out of the database's contents, which divides direct-discourse quotes into conversations and marks them on several aspects (e.g. verb marker, adverb marker, speaker). Currently we are working on a paper about conversations in Jane Austen's novels.

                Demographic Profiling in Wikipedia
        </div>
            Since 2022 I have collaborated with PI <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/lane-rasberry">Lane Rasberry</a> at the UVA School of Data Science on various projects analyzing Wikipedia and Wikidata. Specifically, we have drafted a paper concerning the ethics of demographic profiling on the websites: how they categorize and list (potentially sensitive) information about human beings.
